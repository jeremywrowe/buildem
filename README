Build'em quick, Build'em right

Build'em is a small little script parser that is intended for large build systems.
Build'em is still very young :) so be careful using it.  Input is always welcome and if there is a feature that you just half to have i'd probably do it.


Features:
	
	Execution:
		Scripts go in a plain text file, I use my_very_important_task.buildem
		and then simply call buildem my_very_important_task.buildem
	
	1) Build'em supports sequential tasks (tasks that go in order)
	
		Example:
			run "./task.sh"
			run "./another.sh" #another.sh waits for task.sh to complete

	2) Build'em supports a work queue, what does this mean?
	   This means that you can run tasks concurrently, easily.
	
		Example:
	
		unorderd do
			queued_run "./some_task.sh"
			queued_run "./some_task1.sh"  # All of these items will be executed at the same time
			queued_run "./some_task2.sh"
		end 
	   
	
	   *IMPORTANT*  All queued_run tasks must be inside of an unorderd block if you want them to run at the same time. If you use run for a task, it will block to complete.
	   		That being said you can inject ordered tasks in the middle of unorderd tasks by using run instead of using qeueued_run if you wish to.
	

	3) Configuration
	   To set the worker amount for unorderd tasks before the unorderd block do $configuration.workers = 10 to get 10 nano-bots working for you.
	
	 	Example:
			$configuration.workers = 5
			unorderd do
				....
			end
		
			This will give you 5 nano-bots for your unordered tasks
